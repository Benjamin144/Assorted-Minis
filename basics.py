# Mathematical operations in Python

# 3 + 5
# 7 - 6
# 4 * 5
# print(10 /5) # When divide Python will always convert the mathematical operation to a float
# print(type(10 /5)) # for example the type command identifies this
# print(2 ** 2)
# print(2 ** 3)
# print(2 ** 4)

# Python uses PEMDAS (the priority of mathmatical operations)
# Parenthesis = ()
# Exponents = **
# Multiplication = *
# Division = /
# Addition = +
# Subtraction = -
# (Left)
# (Right)

# Because of the order pf priority the PEMDAS method can look decieving because the IMPORTANCE of operation below are the same
# ()
# **
# * / # However the operation most to the left will be prioritised or sequenced between multiplicaton and division
# + -

# Therefore: PEMDASLR (LR - left/right)
# print(3*3+3/3-3)
# print(type(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)) # 3*3 and 3/3 are of equal importance, but the calculation goes from left to right in order of sequence
# print(3*3/3+3-3) # Here you can use parenthesis() to isolate bits of code that have lower priority in terms of PEMDASLR and therefore turn them into higher priority operations
# # Or:
# print (3*(3+3)/3-3)

# when writing code for example to keep track of a users score

# User scores a point
# rather than using the previous value of score
score = score + 1
# use the short hand

# you can use this method in the following way, to manipulate a value based on its previous value
score -= 1
score /= 1

score = 0
# previously we had to use this type of code
# print("Your score is " + score) # because these are different datatypes the code will return an error
print("Your score is " + str(score)) # so we have to convert the variable into a string to debug the code
print(score)

# sometimes programmers require a more convenient way of storing differing datatypes
score = 0 # integer
height = 1.8 # float
isWinning = True # boolean
print("Your score is ") # find some way of integrating all of the above datatypes into this string
#instead of having to use all of the above data and a whole load of concatenation, then converting them into a string
print("Your score is " +str(score)) #this can be longwinded, and could break leading to alot of frustration.

#f-string
print("Your score is ")
# you type the character f infront of the string and it should go in front of the double or single quotes most importantly 
f"your score is " # this is now an f-string and I can now start adding characters in front of the f-string
# so if I wanted to write "your score is " = to the the variable score I would put the variable score inside a set of curly braces, within the string
print(f"Your Score is {score}") # so when the code is run python will convert the variables within the string in the background, without the use of concatenation and data conversion.
